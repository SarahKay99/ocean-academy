                    <h1>About Ocean Academy</h1>
                    <p>Ocean Academy is a community initiative started by Ocean Ambassadors to help with the onboarding of new ambassadors. Many people, including data owners and data scientists, are not familiar with blockchain and smart contracts yet. And we wanted to have the broadest reach possible, not only address Web3 natives. As we started working on the project, we realized it could serve as an outreach platform for Web3 and Ocean Protocol. So was born Ocean Academy.</p>
